		<p>Flowers are the reproductive structures of flowering plants and have many parts, including:
Sepals: The outermost whorl of the flower, which protects the unopened bud. Sepals are usually green and resemble leaves. 
Petals: The second whorl of the flower, which attracts pollinators. Petals are usually brightly colored. 
Stamens: The male reproductive structures, which contain pollen grains. 
Pistils: The female reproductive structures, which contain ovules. 
Ovules: Contain the female gamete of the plant, known as the ovum or egg. 
Pollen: The food of pollinators, such as bees, wasps, beetles, and flies. Pollen grains can look different between flower types. 
Nectar: A food source for pollinators. </p>
